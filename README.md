Projects featured on my blog at https://there.oughta.be

This repository is a collection of small projects that I share and present on https://there.oughta.be. If they end up here, this usually means that they are not particularly large and that I do not expect to actively maintain them. Nevertheless, if you want to submit a pull request or report an issue, I will see if I can do something, especially if it is a project that I am still using myself.

Note that the folder structure here is a bit annoying to reflect the URL scheme of the blog. A project found at https://there.oughta.be/a/great-project would be found here at https://github.com/Staacks/there.oughta.be/a/great-project. Therefore everything is found in the folders a/ and an/. Most users will follow a deep link into the project in the subfolders anyway.
