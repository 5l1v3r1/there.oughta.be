Projects featured on my blog at https://there.oughta.be

This repository is a collection of small projects that I share and present on https://there.oughta.be. If they end up here, this usually means that they are not particularly large and that I do not expect to actively maintain them. Nevertheless, if you want to submit a pull request or report an issue, I will see if I can do something, especially if it is a project that I am still using myself.
